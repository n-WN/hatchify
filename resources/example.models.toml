# -------------------------------------------------
# How to add more providers
# -------------------------------------------------
# 1. Copy one of the providers blocks above.
# 2. Give it a unique [providers.<id>] section and fill base_url, api_key, enabled, priority.
# 3. Add one or more [[providers.<id>.models]] entries with id, name, max_tokens, context_window, description, enabled (optional).
# 4. Set default_provider to whichever provider you want as the fallback.
# 5. Use priority to control fallback order (lower number = higher priority).
# 6. Set enabled = false on individual models to disable them without removing the provider.
# That's all—repeat as needed to support any number of LLM back-ends.
